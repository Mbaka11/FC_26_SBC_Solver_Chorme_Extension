# Placeholder icon - You need to replace this with actual PNG files
# Create three icon files:
# - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
# - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
# - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

# You can create these using:
# 1. Online tools like Canva, Figma, or Photoshop
# 2. AI image generators
# 3. Icon libraries (flaticon.com, icons8.com)
# 4. Convert existing logos/images

# Suggested icon ideas:
# - Lightning bolt (⚡) on a colored background
# - Soccer ball with a gear/settings icon
# - "SBC" text in a modern font
# - EA FC logo with puzzle piece

# Once you have the icons, delete this file and add the actual PNG files.
